# DonutStack
I implemented only the core mechanic for the donut stack game. 
Its goal is to destroy 3 donuts of one color in a stack. 
A complex algorithm was implemented to find the best path for donuts. 
I did this project as a test task for another company.
Project was developed in 9 days due to the complexity of the algorithm.
